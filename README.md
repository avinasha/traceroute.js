# traceroute.js
A small traceroute script. Uses ActiveX on IE, Java elsewhere, and [TODO] if both fail, falls back to server side. Try it [here](http://myfreeweb.github.com/traceroute.js)!

## Usage
```html
<script src="traceroute.js"></script>
```
```javascript
console.log(traceroute('google.com'));
```
